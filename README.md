# Anomaly Detector

## 📊 About The Project

Anomaly Detector is a web application designed to identify unusual patterns in data streams. The system analyzes incoming data in real-time to detect potential security threats or irregularities, providing users with immediate alerts and visualization tools to investigate detected anomalies.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Continuously monitors data streams to identify outliers and unusual patterns
- **Interactive Visualization Dashboard**: Presents detected anomalies through customizable charts and graphs
- **Alert System**: Notifies users when suspicious activity is detected
- **Historical Analysis**: Stores and allows review of past anomalies for pattern recognition
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allows users to define sensitivity levels for different types of data

## 🎥 Deployment

- **Advanced Visualization**: Additional chart types and visualization options
- **User Profiles**: Custom settings and preferences for different users
- **API Connectivity**: Integration with external data sources
- **Mobile Application**: Companion app for on-the-go monitoring

🚧 Under Construction: This project is actively being developed with new features and improvements added regularly. While the core functionality is operational,
 I'm currently expanding the integration capabilities.

Note: This project is maintained as a private repository for security purposes. The images show a demonstration version with non-sensitive data.
