# Anomaly Detector

## üìä About The Project

Anomaly Detector is a web application designed to identify unusual patterns in data streams. The system analyzes incoming data in real-time to detect potential security threats or irregularities, providing users with immediate alerts and visualization tools to investigate detected anomalies.

### Key Features

- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Continuously monitors data streams to identify outliers and unusual patterns
- **Interactive Visualization Dashboard**: Presents detected anomalies through customizable charts and graphs
- **Alert System**: Notifies users when suspicious activity is detected
- **Historical Analysis**: Stores and allows review of past anomalies for pattern recognition
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Allows users to define sensitivity levels for different types of data

## üìà Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implementing ML algorithms to improve anomaly detection accuracy
- **Advanced Visualization**: Additional chart types and visualization options
- **User Profiles**: Custom settings and preferences for different users
- **API Connectivity**: Integration with external data sources
- **Mobile Application**: Companion app for on-the-go monitoring

üöß Under Construction: This project is actively being developed with new features and improvements added regularly. While the core functionality is operational,
 I'm currently enhancing the machine learning models and expanding the integration capabilities.

Note: This project is maintained as a private repository for security purposes. The images show a demonstration version with non-sensitive data.
